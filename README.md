CMS Core Bundle
===============

Bundle providing dependencies and basic configuration of the [CMS Starter](https://github.com/Th3Mouk/CMSStarter) project, based on the top of [Symfony2][2] and [Sonata Project][1].

This bundle aims to simplify the use of Sonata CMS for developers and future users, trying to not alter the original flexibility, and to give them new basic tools.

## Installation

The documentation is available [here](/Resources/doc/installation.md).

You can include the CMS in your project, very fast, without breaking existing.

If you're starting a new project, you can do it even faster with the command :
```sh
composer create-project th3mouk/cms-starter
```

This command will install Symfony 2.8 with this bundle pre-installed, and some other tools.
(Grunt, bower, LESS support, minimification)
