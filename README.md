CMS Core Bundle
===============

Bundle providing dependencies and basic configuration of the [CMS Starter](https://github.com/Th3Mouk/CMSStarter) project, based on the top of [Symfony2][2] and [Sonata Project][1].

This bundle aims to simplify the use of Sonata CMS for developers and future users, trying to not alter the original flexibility, and to give them new basic tools.
